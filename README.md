# ProgramingNotes
A little project of a programing note application using Tkinter

## Dev comment
I have done quite a bit today actually. The Tkinter framework is pretty easy to get the hang of. The biggest issue right now is the DB which i plan to save to local files (Acctually dont know why i want to do it this way...),


## TODO
- I might try to use pysondb!! : https://dev.to/fredysomy/pysondb-a-json-based-lightweight-database-for-python-ija
- Make CRUD commands
- Another option might be to use a json or sql database? Might be good as a remainder.
- Plan out a GUI
- Plan out the code files(Class diagram maybe).
